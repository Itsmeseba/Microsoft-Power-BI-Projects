**Basic Data Cleaning for Global Superstore Data**
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Global Superstore dataset in Power BI based on stakeholder requirements. The goal was to ensure the data is accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis by addressing common issues such as missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicate records.

**Data Cleaning Steps
Orders Sheet:**
**Promoted Headers:** Ensured that the first row is used as headers for the dataset.
**Changed Data Types:** Corrected the data types of columns as per the required format (e.g., dates, numbers).
**Replaced Values:** Standardized and cleaned up inconsistent values.
**Removed Duplicates:** Eliminated duplicate records based on the Row ID column to ensure unique entries.

**People Sheet:**
**Promoted Headers:** The first row was promoted to serve as column headers.
**Changed Data Types:** Adjusted data types to the correct formats for better consistency and analysis.
**Filtered Rows:** Applied filters to remove unnecessary rows that do not meet specific criteria.
**Removed Blank Rows:** Cleaned up the dataset by removing any rows with missing or incomplete data.
**Returns Sheet:**
**Promoted Headers:** Ensured the first row was used as column headers.
**Changed Data Types:** Set the appropriate data types for accurate analysis.
**Removed Duplicates:** Removed any duplicate entries to ensure clean and unique data.
**Conclusion**
These steps ensure the Global Superstore dataset is cleaned and optimized for further analysis, minimizing errors and improving the overall quality of insights derived from the data.
